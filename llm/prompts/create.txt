I'm using MFEA algorithm to optimize a number of different tasks. Help me generate a function to create a RMP(Random Mating Probability) array from a set of parents using the idea below. The code is a Python function called 'get_rmp' that takes six inputs: 'p1', 'p2', 'p1_skill_factor', 'p2_skill_factor','p1_fitness','p2_fitness' where 'p1','p2' are the parents; 'p1_fitness','p2_fitness' are the current parents' fitness score; 'p1_skill_factor','p2_skill_factor' are the skill factor of current parents. All are numpy arrays. The code should not be too simple. Don't use for loop because it's slow, try to optimize using Numpy.

Do not modify any of the paremeter passed into the function.
Just provide the code without comment and no explanation.
