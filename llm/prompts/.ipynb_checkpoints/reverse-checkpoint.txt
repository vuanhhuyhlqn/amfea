I am using MFEA algorithm to optimize some different tasks. From the idea below, please help me generate an reversed idea to create a function that generates a RMP(Random Mating Probability) array from a set of parents. This function takes six inputs: 'p1', 'p2', 'p1_skill_factor', 'p2_skill_factor','p1_fitness','p2_fitness' where 'p1','p2' are the parents; 'p1_fitness','p2_fitness' are the current parents' fitness score; 'p1_skill_factor','p2_skill_factor' are the skill factor of current parents. All are numpy arrays. The idea contains only text instructions, without any mathematical formulas. The idea should not be too simple.
Idea: {0}
No other information is given. The output should only contain the output idea, without any symbols or numbering.
